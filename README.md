# Doublethink: Disables Normalization

## About:
This addon allows UTF-8 friendly characters by preventing normalization of field contents during imports, edits, and browser searches. Media, tag, and deck names are normalized, for technical reasons.


### Asian Characters:
Kanji, Hanzi, Hanja. JIS-3 character set and others.
